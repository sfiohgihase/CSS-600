## WHAT IS IT?

This is an agent-based model about migration from people using the southwestern United States-Mexico border to enter the United States. The model looks at the behavior and decision-making in regard to how they travel to the border, and how group dynamics and the influence of other people can play a role in the trajectory under different U.S. border-policy scenarios.

## HOW IT WORKS

The agents are generated on the landscape proportional to the size of the population in the Mexican districts and Central American countries. Each agent is endowed with willingness-to-migrate, risk-aversion, and means-to-migrate attributes, which is user defined via sliders on the model interface. The model enables the user to explore how different decision-making and communication processes are used by the agents to decide on which U.S. border port of entry the agent will choose. In addition, the user can impose effects of border restrictions to limit the capacity of the number of migrants that are allowed to cross the border at the ports of entry.

To set up the model, press the first button "1. model-setup" to create the environment and load the base map layers for land, water, and the borders. After the model map display has been loaded, the user can adjust the initial parameters for agent’s willingness-to-migrate, risk-aversion, and means-to-migrate which is used during the population creation. The population of agents will be created by pressing the second button "2. setup-population". The number of agents on the display will be proportional to the population sizes for each Mexican district based on the 2015 Mexico census population estimates and based on the latest population size estimates for the Central American countries. The agents are initialized at random locations within their district if they are in Mexico. Otherwise they are initialized in their country.

To run the model, the "3. run-model" button will run the model which starts by agents considering whether or not to migrate based on their willingness-to-migrate, risk-aversion, and means-to-migrate. The agents who choose to migrate will then pick a U.S. border port of entry based on the current border-choice drop-down selection the user of the model specifies. The migrants will then travel towards their chosen border crossing goal and each model iteration (tick) of one day the agent will reassess their goal based on the nearest crossing or information from other agents if the border-choice is for caravan or network-hometown.
Once the agents arrive at the border, the impact of the border-restriction setting from the model interface will impact what percent of migrants are allowed to cross the border each day as capacity. If migrants are unsuccessful at crossing when they arrive at the border, they randomly choose whether to wait or to choose another segment of the border or port of entry.

Border-choice: While each agent is initialized with the nearest port of entry, as soon as the model starts running the agents will update their desired border crossing point based on the user specified option for border-choice on the model GUI. 

The border-choice drop down enables the agents to update their desired border crossing location each iteration (which represents a day) based on the following:

- border-random: each agent randomly chooses a port of entry and heads towards it.
- border-nearest: each agent picks the nearest port of entry to their current location.
- border-caravan: each agent updates their desired port of entry to be the most common - border crossing goal location shared by the nearby (Moore neighborhood) migrating agents when there are 3 or more within the vicinity.
- border-network-hometown: each agent updates their desired port-of-entry based on the most common border crossing location that was successfully crossed by other agents from the same originating neighborhood (hometown). When there are no other agents within the hometown, then the district is used, and for Central American countries only the country level is considered. 

Border-restriction: The user of the model can toggle on or off border restrictions while the model is running to examine the impacts. Border restriction on only enables a 50-50 chance of the migrant at the port of entry to be allowed to cross that day.


## THINGS TO NOTICE

While the mode and speed of travel in reality will vary greatly per migrant, the model assumes that migrants travel approximately 30km a day, which was based on reporting from 2018. Thus, each model iteration (tick) represents one day and the size of each patch is approximately 30km.

Our research found that the user selected border-choice option for  border-network-hometown yielded volume of migrants across the ports of entry to be the most similar to the actual volumes reported by the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol numbers for the years 2015-2018. This indicates that when modeling migration movements and patterns, it is important to represent the social network used by agents rather than just random or directed movement such as choosing the nearest border (which would be also similar to a gravity model).


## THINGS TO TRY

The average willingness to migrate, risk, and means need to be adjusted before creating the population. Note that only agents that are able to migrate will be displayed as green triangles. It may appear that there are no agents if the conditions are set in such a way as the willingness to migrate is too high, risk-aversion is too high, and means to migrate is too low.

The user can change the decision-making and communication processes among the agents by changing the border-choice even while the model is running. This may change the direction some of the migrants are traveling as they adjust to a different port of entry. 

The user can change the display to show the agents moving as green triangles pointing in the direction they are headed or to represent the population density of the agents as they move as tan colored patches with darker tan representing higher population density. Changing the population-display to Mexico will show the color of each agent based on their district.

When the model is open, the model setup only needs to be run once by pressing the button "1. model-setup". Because loading GIS data into the model can take some time, we set up the model so that the GIS data only needs to be loaded once and subsequent model runs can just remove the population and clear plots and still run again. Thus, for any subsequent runs of the model can be done by just pressing "2. setup-population" and then running the model again by adjusting any sliders or options desired, and then pressing "3. run-model". The speed of which the model runs can be adjusted by a slider on the Netlogo interface. The model can be started and stopped by pressing the "3. run-model". The model will automatically stop when there are no more agents left to migrate.


## EXTENDING THE MODEL

The model could be expanded to support road following and also to incorporate other travel challenges related to topography and could also add location of cities as population centers to create agents or to allow stop overs or destinations.

Currently the focus of this model is on crossing at the main ports of entry. There are other locations where crossings occur legally and illegally along the border that could also be incorporated. In addition, capacity per each port-of-entry could be adjusted.

The model could also be extended to include policing on both sides of the border, Mexican migration policies, and other external data that could be weighed by the agents such as socio-economic data and political climate.
